## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run PDFToolkit locally for development or personal use.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for containerized setup)

### 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

You can run PDFToolkit using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t pdftoolkit .
docker run -p 3000:8080 pdftoolkit:latest
```

Open your browser at: http://localhost:3000

This is the fastest way to try PDFToolkit without setting up a development environment.

### 🏠 Self-Hosting

Since PDFToolkit is fully client-side, all processing happens in the user's browser and no server-side processing is required. This means you can host PDFToolkit as simple static files on any web server or hosting platform.

**Download from Releases (Recommended):**

The easiest way to self-host is to download the pre-built distribution file. Each release includes a `dist-{version}.zip` file that contains all necessary files for self-hosting.

1. Download the latest `dist-{version}.zip` file
2. Extract the zip file
3. Serve the extracted folder with your preferred web server
   
**Navigate to the extracted Folder:**
```bash
# Navigate to the extracted folder
cd dist-1.7.3  # Replace with your version
```

**Serve with Python:**

```bash
# For Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
```

The website can be accessible at: ```http://[::1]:8000/```

**Serve with Node.js:**

```bash
# Install a simple server
npx serve .

# Or if you have serve installed globally
npm install -g serve
serve .
```

The website can be accessible at: ```http://localhost:3000/```

**Serve with other tools:**

You can also use other static file servers like:
- Go: `go run main.go` with a simple Go server
- PHP: `php -S localhost:8000`
- Ruby: `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000`

The website can be accessible at:
- Go: ```http://localhost:8080/``` (default) or as specified
- PHP: ```http://localhost:8000/```
- Ruby: ```http://localhost:8000/``` (default port can be changed)

Simply serve the extracted folder using any static file server, and PDFToolkit will work completely client-side without any server-side dependencies.

**Build from Source (Advanced):**

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alam00000/pdftoolkit.git
cd pdftoolkit

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Package the distribution for hosting (optional)
npm run package

# Serve the dist folder
npx serve dist

The website can be accessible at: http://localhost:3000/

```

**Subdirectory Hosting:**

PDFToolkit can also be hosted from a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/tools/pdftoolkit/`):

```bash

# Example:
# 1. Build the app with the specific BASE_URL. BASE_URL must have a trailing and leading slash.

BASE_URL=/tools/pdftoolkit/ npm run build

# 2. Create the nested directory structure
mkdir -p serve-test/tools/pdftoolkit

# 3. Copy all files from the 'dist' folder into that nested directory
cp -r dist/* serve-test/tools/pdftoolkit/

# 4. Serve the 'serve-test' folder
npx serve serve-test
```

The website can be accessible at: ```http://localhost:3000/tools/pdftoolkit/```

The `npm run package` command creates a `dist-{version}.zip` file that you can use for self-hosting.

### 🚀 Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

For a more robust setup with auto-restart capabilities:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:

```yaml
services:
  pdftoolkit:
    build: .
    container_name: pdftoolkit
    ports:
      - '3000:8080'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. **Start the application**:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🏢 Simple Mode for Internal Use

For organizations that want a clean, distraction-free interface focused solely on PDF tools, PDFToolkit supports a **Simple Mode** that hides all branding and marketing content.

**What Simple Mode does:**

- Hides navigation, hero section, features, FAQ, testimonials, and footer
- Shows only the essential PDF tools
- Updates page title to "PDF Tools"
- Perfect for internal company tools and educational institutions

For more details, see [SIMPLE_MODE.md](SIMPLE_MODE.md).

### 🔒 Security Features

PDFToolkit runs as a non-root user using nginx-unprivileged for enhanced security:

- **Non-Root Execution**: Container runs with minimal privileges using nginx-unprivileged
- **Port 8080**: Uses high port number to avoid requiring root privileges
- **Security Best Practices**: Follows Principle of Least Privilege

#### Basic Usage

```bash
docker build -t pdftoolkit .
docker run -p 8080:8080 pdftoolkit
```

For detailed security configuration, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

#### Quick Release

```bash
# Release a patch version (0.0.1 → 0.0.2)
npm run release

# Release a minor version (0.0.1 → 0.1.0)
npm run release:minor

# Release a major version (0.0.1 → 1.0.0)
npm run release:major
```

For detailed release instructions, see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

### 🚀 Development Setup

#### Option 1: Run with npm

1. **Clone or download the repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Option 2: Build and Run with Docker Compose

1. **Run with Docker Compose**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

   > **Note:** After making any local changes to the code, rebuild the Docker image using:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
   ```

   This ensures your latest changes are applied inside the container.
